# Ad Astra Infinity!
Ad Astra Infinity is ***going*** to be an addon mod for [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra) designed by ArchangelTheGod which expands upon the galaxies beyond with a touch of the MCU!

## The Vision:
This mod is meant to be a mere mimic of what the MCU already has! Custom Planets, Structures, OP Items, You name it! Why is it called ***Infinity*** you may ask? This mod's other purpose
is to add the infinity stones into Minecraft! You can use the famed **Infinity Gauntlet** to obliterate entire dimensions or use the vibranium to create a synthezoid injector and turn into
Ultron/Vision! The possibilities are, well, **Infinite!** As the mod reaches a more refined stage away from the ``alpha`` and ``beta`` stages/releases, I will *slowly* begin adding slightly
more and more features & items to keep the mod fresh and enjoyable. This includes crisp animations, detailed textures & 3D models, satisfying sounds- all the things that make a good mod!

Suggestions are welcome!
